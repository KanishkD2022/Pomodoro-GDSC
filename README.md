#Pomodoro Timer

#Some Basic Facts about Pomodoro Technique
A Pomodoro timer was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s as a simple time management tool to focus and enhance one’s productivity. The basic technique used is the division of work: one works for a set period, “a Pomodoro” traditionally 25 minutes, and then takes a short break. The Pomodoro timer consists of the following aspects:

“Work sessions : One Pomodoro divides your work into focused sessions” For 25 minutes, you focus only on your job and are not distracted from it; 
“Breaks : Once one Pomodoro is complete, you need to schedule a 5-minute of rest." Relax before the next work session begins.

Some features: 
Focusing and Productivity: It helps in focusing on work and increasing productivity. It separates work into manageable intervals, allowing a person to focus all the entire time and not get burned out. Furthermore, It allows maintain their concentration due to frequent breaks. 
Adaptability: Although conventional Pomodoros are 25 minutes, a person may adjust their Pomodoro depending on how long or short you want their work interval to be. The work-bake balance can also be changed depending on the type of task you are focusing on. 
Timer Tools: Pomodoro timers come in many types, such as physical timers, application timers, and incorporated in the productivity app to keep track of work and break time.
